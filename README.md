# The Problem
The challenge faced by refugees with limited German language skills, as well as difficulties in reading and writing, when handling authority mail is a significant and pressing issue. When refugees receive official correspondence from government agencies, such as letters from immigration authorities, social welfare offices, or other relevant institutions, their lack of language proficiency can create a multitude of problems.

# The Solution
Understanding official documents often goes hand in hand with the ability to read and comprehend the content. Through our app's scanning feature, refugees can easily capture their documents. Once scanned, the app will extract the text and ensure accurate translations.
In addition to this feature our app goes on step further by offering video tutorials. When available, these tutorials guide refugees through the process of filling out specific official documents.
In conclusion, our app is designed to address the unique challenges faced by refugees when dealing with all kinds of documents.
